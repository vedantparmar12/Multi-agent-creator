## Discovered During Work

### High Priority
- [ ] **Create PRP Tool** 
  - Tool to generate PRPs from within agent conversations
  - Tool to execute PRPs directly
  - Integration with orchestrator

- [ ] **Update Config for Context**
  - Add context_engineering section to config.yaml
  - Configure validation commands
  - Add context-aware prompts

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Create CLI Commands**
  - Add /generate-prp command
  - Add /execute-prp command
  - Update help documentation

- [ ] **Enhance Orchestrator**
  - Share context between parallel agents
  - Add PRP-based task decomposition
  - Improve error handling

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Add More Examples**
  - Multi-agent patterns
  - Complex tool implementations
  - Testing patterns

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Profile context loading
  - Optimize large file handling
  - Add context size limits

## Future Features

1. **RAG Integration**
   - Vector store for code search
   - Semantic similarity for examples
   - Dynamic context selection

2. **Visual PRP Editor**
   - Web UI for PRP creation
   - Template management
   - Validation preview

3. **Agent Marketplace**
   - Share agent configurations
   - Community tools
   - PRP templates library

## Notes

- Context system significantly improves agent success rate
- PRP workflow enables complex feature implementation
- Validation loops catch most errors before deployment
- Examples are critical for pattern matching
